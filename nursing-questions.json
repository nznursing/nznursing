            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60-100 beats per minute. 40-60 is too low and would be considered bradycardia. 100-120 and 120-150 are both elevated and would be considered tachycardia, which is not normal at rest in adults."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The correct sequence is: mask, goggles, gown, then gloves. This sequence ensures your hands remain clean while handling and adjusting items that touch your face. Putting gloves on first (options C and D) would contaminate other items as you touch them. Putting the gown on first (option A) could contaminate it while adjusting the mask and goggles."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The correct sequence for removing PPE is: gloves, gown, goggles, mask. You remove the most contaminated items (gloves) first, followed by the gown. Eye protection comes off next, and the mask is removed last since it's on your face. Options A, B, and C all involve removing cleaner items before more contaminated ones or removing face protection too early."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Tuberculosis requires airborne precautions because the bacteria can remain suspended in the air and travel on air currents. Standard precautions alone (option A) are insufficient. Contact precautions (option B) are for organisms transmitted by physical contact. Droplet precautions (option C) are for larger respiratory particles that don't remain suspended in air."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, then to the lungs for oxygenation. It returns to the left atrium, flows to the left ventricle, and is then pumped to the body. Option B reverses the sides. Option C incorrectly shows blood flowing between atria first. Option D completely reverses the sequence."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Increased body temperature is not typically associated with hypovolemic shock. In fact, patients in shock often become hypothermic. Decreased blood pressure (option A), increased heart rate (option B), and decreased urine output (option C) are all classic signs of hypovolemic shock as the body tries to compensate for decreased blood volume."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "S1, the first heart sound ('lub'), is produced by closure of the atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid). S2 (option B) is produced by closure of the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary). S3 and S4 (options C and D) are extra heart sounds that may indicate pathology and are not related to valve closure."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Nasal cannula at 2 L/min delivers approximately 24-28% FiO2. Each liter of oxygen via nasal cannula adds approximately 4% to the baseline room air FiO2 of 21%. Therefore, 2 L/min would add 8%, resulting in 29% (or the range 24-28%). Option B (28-32%) would correspond to 3 L/min, option C (35-40%) to 4-5 L/min, and option D (40-50%) to higher flow rates or different delivery devices."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing collapse (atelectasis) during expiration. It doesn't increase airway resistance (option A) - that would impair breathing. Mucus production (option C) is done by goblet cells, not surfactant. Oxygen transport to blood (option D) occurs through diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane, not via surfactant."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Positioning the patient to maximize oxygenation (typically upright/high Fowler's position) is the highest priority nursing intervention for acute respiratory distress. This immediately helps improve gas exchange. Pain medication (option A) may be important but isn't the highest priority in respiratory distress. Obtaining a chest X-ray (option C) and drawing ABGs (option D) are diagnostic measures, not immediate interventions to improve oxygenation."

            "explanation": "Non-blanchable erythema (redness that doesn't turn white when pressed) is an early sign of pressure injury (Stage 1). Black eschar (option A) indicates full-thickness tissue damage with necrosis (Stage 3-4). Full-thickness tissue loss (option B) is a Stage 3 pressure injury. Undermining and tunneling (option D) are seen in advanced Stage 3-4 pressure injuries with extensive tissue damage."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coughing when irrigation is attempted suggests the tube may be in the respiratory tract rather than the stomach, which is a serious complication requiring immediate intervention. A pH of 3.5 (option A) indicates acidic stomach contents, suggesting correct placement. A respiratory rate of 16 (option B) is normal. Gurgling sounds during auscultation (option D) may indicate correct placement in the stomach."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supine with legs elevated (modified Trendelenburg) is recommended as it helps return blood to the central circulation and brain, which is beneficial during syncope. Prone position (option A) could obstruct the airway. Full Trendelenburg position (option B) is excessive for most syncope. Semi-Fowler's position (option D) would keep blood pooled in the lower extremities rather than promoting return to the brain."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The vastus lateralis (thigh) muscle is the preferred site for IM injections in infants as it's well-developed and away from major nerves and blood vessels. The deltoid (option A) is too small in infants. The ventrogluteal (option B) and dorsogluteal (option D) sites are not well-developed in infants and are more difficult to identify correctly."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Normal pupillary light reflex results in bilateral pupil constriction (both pupils constrict when light is shone in one eye). This is called the consensual light reflex. Unilateral constriction only (option A) would indicate a neurological issue. Pupil dilation (option C) is the opposite of the expected response. No change (option D) would indicate an abnormal response."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Speaking calmly and using short, clear sentences helps anxious patients process information better. Multiple rapid questions (option A) would increase anxiety. Medical terminology (option B) may confuse and increase anxiety. Dismissing concerns with statements like 'don't worry' (option D) invalidates the patient's feelings and doesn't address their anxiety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Open-ended questions encourage patients to express themselves fully and promote therapeutic communication. Giving personal advice (option A) imposes the nurse's values and isn't patient-centered. Changing uncomfortable subjects (option C) avoids important issues.

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the patient's experience without validating the hallucination shows respect while maintaining reality. Telling patients their perceptions aren't real (option A) may cause them to become defensive or distrustful. Pretending to share hallucinations (option B) reinforces false perceptions. Ignoring the behavior (option D) misses an opportunity to assess and intervene."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The tunica media (middle layer) is significantly thinner in veins compared to arteries. This is because veins don't need to withstand the high pressures that arteries do. The tunica intima (option A) is similar in both. The tunica adventitia (option C) is actually proportionally thicker in veins than in arteries. Option D is incorrect because not all layers are proportionally thinner."

Elevated serum calcium levels (option A) may indicate hypercalcemia, which can occur in conditions like hyperparathyroidism. Inflammation of the synovial membrane (option C) occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory joint conditions.

          "explanation": "\"Patient's blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg\" is objective data because it is measurable and observable using equipment. The other options are subjective data: \"Patient states pain is 8/10\" (option A) and \"Patient reports feeling nauseated since breakfast\" (option D) are the patient's perceptions or statements. \"Patient appears anxious\" (option B) is the nurse's interpretation of observed behavior, not a measurable finding."

While hyperglycemia (option A) can occur with clozapine and other atypical antipsychotics, it's not the most serious side effect requiring specialized monitoring. Clozapine typically causes hypotension, not hypertension (option C). Decreased libido, not increased libido (option D), may occur with antipsychotics."

          "explanation": "Cultural safety focuses on the patient's experience and outcomes - whether they feel safe and respected - while cultural competence focuses on the healthcare provider's knowledge, skills, and attitudes. This distinction is important as cultural safety shifts the power dynamic to center the patient's perspective. Option A reverses this relationship. While cultural safety did originate in New Zealand (related to option C), both concepts are now used internationally.

          "explanation": "A key principle of cultural safety as developed by Irihapeti Ramsden is that nurses must examine the potential impact of their own culture, biases, and position of power on their clinical practice. This self-reflection is central to cultural safety. Simply learning about different cultures (option A) describes cultural awareness, not cultural safety. Providing identical care to all patients (option C) ignores cultural differences and needs.

          "explanation": "Patient acuity-based staffing is the principle being applied when patient assignments are made based on the complexity of patient needs matched to staff skill levels and experience. This approach prioritizes patient safety and appropriate care. Autocratic leadership (option A) refers to a directive leadership style. Seniority-based assignment (option C) would assign based on length of service alone, not skill matching. Task-oriented leadership (option D) focuses on completing tasks rather than matching patient needs to staff capabilities."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 2,
          "explanation": "In palliative care, opioids should be given by the clock (at regular intervals) rather than on demand. This maintains steady blood levels of the medication and provides more effective pain control. Opioids are not a last resort in palliative care (option A) but are often essential for effective pain management. Waiting until pain is severe (option B) allows breakthrough pain and suffering. While IV administration (option D) may be used, the route depends on the patient's condition and preferences; oral routes are commonly used when possible."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Recognizing the importance of extended family (aiga/kāinga) involvement in care is most important when caring for Pacific Island patients at end of life. Many Pacific cultures have strong family-centered values where extended family plays a crucial role in decision-making and care. Limiting family members (option A) would disrespect this cultural value. Discouraging traditional practices (option C) is culturally insensitive. While respecting family hierarchies is important, communication protocols vary among Pacific cultures and assuming all communication must go through the eldest male (option D) is an overgeneralization."

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Administration of anticholinergic medications (such as hyoscine butylbromide) is the most appropriate approach for managing terminal respiratory secretions. These medications reduce secretion production. Aggressive suctioning (option A) can be traumatic and is generally not recommended in end-of-life care. Increasing oxygen (option C) does not address the secretion issue and may not provide comfort.

These documents allow individuals to express their healthcare preferences in advance, respecting their right to make decisions about their own care. While beneficence (doing good, option A), justice (fairness, option B), and non-maleficence (avoiding harm, option C) are all important ethical principles in palliative care, advance directives specifically uphold patient autonomy."

'A' stands for Airway, 'B' for Breathing, 'D' for Disability (neurological status), and 'E' for Exposure/Environment. While 'Cardiovascular' (option A) is related, 'Circulation' is the specific term used in this framework. 'Consciousness' (option C) is assessed under 'D' for Disability.

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Epinephrine (Adrenaline) should be immediately available during a cardiac arrest as it is a first-line medication in cardiac arrest protocols (ACLS guidelines). It increases coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure during CPR. Metoprolol (option A) is a beta-blocker used for various cardiovascular conditions but not in cardiac arrest. Furosemide (option B) is a diuretic not used in immediate cardiac arrest management. Insulin (option D) is used for glycemic control and not indicated during cardiac arrest."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute would typically trigger the highest score in most Early Warning Score systems. Elevated respiratory rate is often one of the earliest indicators of deterioration. A heart rate of 95 (option A) is only slightly elevated and would receive a low score. Oxygen saturation of 92% (option C) would receive a moderate score. Blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg (option D) is within normal limits and would likely receive a score of zero in most EWS systems."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A patient with an obstructed airway who is unconscious should receive attention first, following the 'ABC' (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) priority. Airway obstruction is an immediate life threat. A patient with an open femur fracture but stable vital signs (option A) is a priority but less urgent than an airway issue. A patient with chest pain but normal breathing (option B) requires urgent assessment but after immediate life threats. A patient with minor lacerations (option D) would be classified as non-urgent in triage systems."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "With an advanced airway in place during two-rescuer CPR, the correct approach is continuous compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute with 1 ventilation every 6 seconds (10 breaths per minute). The rescuers no longer need to pause compressions for ventilations when an advanced airway is in place. A 15:2 ratio (option A) is used for children with two rescuers when no advanced airway is present. A 30:2 ratio (option B) is used for adults with no advanced airway. Option D has the correct compression rate but an incorrect ventilation frequency."

            "explanation": "Smoking cessation strategies are the most important education topic for a newly diagnosed COPD patient, as smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention to slow disease progression. While palliative care (option A) and end-of-life preferences (option D) may become relevant later in the disease course, they are not typically priority education topics at initial diagnosis. Long-term oxygen therapy (option C) is not indicated for all COPD patients and would only be discussed if clinically appropriate based on assessment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increased blood pressure often indicates worsening chronic kidney disease, as the kidneys play a crucial role in blood pressure regulation. Hypertension is both a cause and consequence of kidney damage. Increased urine output (option A) typically indicates improved kidney function, not worsening. Decreased serum creatinine (option B) suggests improved kidney function (creatinine rises as kidney function declines). Decreased peripheral edema (option D) would suggest improved fluid balance, not worsening kidney function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regular toileting schedules and responding promptly to call bells are priority interventions for preventing falls in elderly patients, as they address common reasons for unassisted mobility attempts (toileting needs) and reduce risky behavior. Administering sedatives (option A) increases fall risk by causing drowsiness and impaired balance. Keeping patients in bed constantly (option B) leads to deconditioning, reduced muscle strength, and increased fall risk when the patient does get up. Using restraints (option D) is not recommended as a fall prevention strategy as it violates autonomy and can lead to increased agitation and injury."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Facing the patient, speaking clearly at a moderate pace, and reducing background noise is the most appropriate approach for communicating with hearing-impaired patients. This allows the patient to potentially lip-read, better hear what is being said without distortion, and maintains dignity. Speaking very loudly (option A) can distort sounds and be perceived as shouting. Writing all communication (option C) may be helpful in some cases but is impractical for all interactions and excludes patients with literacy challenges. Communicating primarily through family members (option D) disempowers the patient and violates their autonomy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using professional interpreters rather than family members is most important when language barriers exist with refugee patients. Professional interpreters ensure accurate communication, patient privacy, and avoid placing family members (especially children) in inappropriate roles. Assuming all refugees share cultural practices (option A) ignores the diversity among refugee populations. While sensitivity is needed, completely avoiding discussions about past experiences (option B) may prevent important health information from being shared. Making decisions for patients (option D) violates autonomy and may replicate power dynamics that refugees have previously experienced."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Considering transport and distance challenges when planning follow-up care is particularly important for rural patients in New Zealand. This recognizes the practical barriers to accessing healthcare while finding solutions that work within these constraints. Recommending relocation to urban areas (option A) is unrealistic and ignores attachments to community and place. Assuming all rural patients have support networks (option C) may overlook social isolation that can exist in rural areas. Providing only basic care (option D) perpetuates healthcare inequity and fails to consider telehealth options and visiting specialist services."
